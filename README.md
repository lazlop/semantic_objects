# Semantic Objects

The goal of this repository is to make it easy to extend ontologies for cyberphysical systems (particularly those based on Brick, ASHRAE 223P, and WATR). 

The classes can be used for multiple purposes: 
 - Creating SHACL/Ontology statements for validation of existing semantic models or use in other tools
 - Creation of templates to enable use of BuildingMOTIF or other resources for creating building models
 - Loading of semantic models into python objects to improve ease of processing
